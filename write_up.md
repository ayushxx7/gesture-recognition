Try with $1\times 2\times 2$ filter in Conv3D Layer.                      |

| 7 | CNN + RNN (Transfer Learning w/ ResNet) | Training Time too high | GPU was disabled | reduce batch size |
| 8 | CNN + RNN (Transfer Learning w/ ResNet) | Memory Error | Even just loading ResNet was consuming 3+ GB out of 4GB of GPU Ram | use different model for transfer learning |
| 9 | CNN + RNN (Transfer Learning w/ MobileNet) | Validation Accuracy - 87% | Transfer Learning to understand image features. Using timedistributed Layer with GRU to understand Sequence | Increase number of epochs  |
